# Overlap plots R BioConductor package

This R BioConductor package provides functionalities for generating overlap plots, which visualize the intersection and overlap of genomic regions or features. It is an adaptation of the OverlapPlots code originally developed by Aayush Raman.

# Introduction

Overlap plots are commonly used in genomics and bioinformatics to visualize the relationships between different sets of genomic regions, such as peaks from ChIP-seq experiments, transcription factor binding sites, or genomic annotations. These plots help researchers understand the extent of overlap between various genomic features, identify common patterns, and gain insights into biological processes.
